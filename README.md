This repository contains group projects completed for Intro to AI @ Rutgers University, in Spring 2024:

* Project1
* Intro_to_AI_Homework_2.pdf
* Intro_to_AI_Homework_3.pdf
* OCR_FaceDetection Project
## OCR_FaceDetection Project
* Has applications in home security systems, to detect the unplanned presence of people indoors (B&E) or outdoors (trespassing etc.)
  - The Face Detection model can be loaded into an arduino/raspberry pi connected to a security camera.
  - This camera can then take pictures every 15-30 milliseconds, detect faces, and send a notification to the homeowner when a face is detected inside (when the homeowner is not home) or outside (like a Ring camera)

Collaborators include Abhay Dhiman and Roshan Patel
