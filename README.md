# Intro-to-AI-Group-Projects

This repository contains group projects completed for Intro to AI @ Rutgers University, in Spring 2024:

* Project1
* Intro_to_AI_Homework_2.pdf
* Intro_to_AI_Homework_3.pdf
* OCR_FaceDetection Project
## OCR_FaceDetection Project
* A practical application of this project is that the Face Detection model can be loaded into an arduino or a raspberry pi and connected to a security camera.
  - This camera can then take pictures every 15-30 milliseconds, detect faces, and send a notification to the homeowner when a face is detected inside (when the homeowner is not home) or outside (like a Ring camera)

Collaborators include Abhay Dhiman and Roshan Patel
